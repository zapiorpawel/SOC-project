# Security Operation Center Project using Wazuh, SolarWinds, and NetFlow
The aim of the project is to implement NetFlow and Wazuh technologies for monitoring the network to effectively identify attacks on the Active Directory service. By analyzing network traffic using NetFlow and leveraging threat detection capabilities provided by Wazuh, the project aims to enable detection of anomalies and suspicious activities related to the Active Directory service. Integrating these tools will facilitate effective monitoring and response to potential threats, thereby enhancing the security level of Active Directory-based network infrastructure.
